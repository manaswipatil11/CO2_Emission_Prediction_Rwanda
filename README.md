# CO2_Emission_Prediction_Rwanda
The Kaggle Competition of Playground Series to predict CO2 emission in Rwanda

The "Prediction of CO2 Emissions in Rwanda" project delves into the intricate relationship between various socio-economic and environmental factors and their influence on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the context of Rwanda. As one of the fastest-growing economies in East Africa, Rwanda's development trajectory presents both opportunities and challenges in terms of managing its carbon footprint and sustainable growth.

This project centers around conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful insights and patterns within a diverse dataset. The primary objective is to build a foundation for developing accurate predictive models for CO2 emissions, thereby aiding policymakers, environmentalists, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to curb and mitigate the country's carbon emissions.

These are my beginner-level submissions. Learning and exploring new possibilities. Hope this helps you.
